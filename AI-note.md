Prepare Your Storybook
Before we move the storybook, we need to make sure it's ready for the special library (GitHub Pages). If you haven't done this yet, go to your project's folder with your magic wand and use the spell npm install gh-pages --save-dev. This spell prepares your book for its new home.

5. Tell Your Storybook Where It’s Going
Open your storybook’s guide (the package.json file in your project), and add a line that tells it where it will live in the special library. It looks something like this:

json
Copy code

```js
"homepage": "http://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>",
```

Replace <your-github-username> with your GitHub username and <your-repo-name> with the name of the special box (repository) you created.


```js
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
},
```
This tells the magic wand how to prepare and move your storybook.

Use Your Magic Wand
Go back to your magic wand, and in the place where your storybook lies (project folder), cast the following spell:

bash
Copy code
```
npm run deploy

```
